# REST API with Flask and Python

This repository contains the code for a REST API created using Flask and Python. The API was created by following the steps described and explained in the course [REST API with Flask and Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/rest-api-flask-and-python/) by Jose Salvatierra.

## Getting Started

To run the API, first make sure you have Python 3.10 (or higher) installed. Then, you can install the dependencies by running the following command:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

You then can run the API by running the following command:

`flask run`

I hope this helps!
